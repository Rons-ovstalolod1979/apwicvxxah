Wow, okay, just walked out the theater, and my head's still spinning, so let me try to make sense of Drop... popcorn crumbs are all over my jeans and this bench is cold and is my back always this crunchy or was it the chair? Anyway, the movie... man, uh... that scene with the bird, right? Like, are we the bird or is the bird us? Couldn’t stop thinking about what Ehrlich said about mutualism in species. Felt like my brain was in a washing machine with rocks in it.

It's funny, I caught myself reaching to download the movie halfway through, but like, is that even legal? Who even watches movies properly anymore? Like actually sitting through them without pausing a bunch? Felt like the theater was a zoo enclosure -- for us, for everyone. Someone definitely needed to tranquilize that baby two rows back. But then again, maybe chaos was part of the movie, blending us together like the bats in that cave scene. Echolocation vibes everywhere.

> Right, so the part where gravity just... stopped. Whoa, okay. The apples floating reminded me of that botfly larvae extraction video I once saw. Weirdly satisfying, but in a what even is life? kind of way. Made me miss the fieldwork, wrestling with anacondas, which, by the way, is kinda less daunting than the soda price at the concession stand.

Was it you who asked about how to watch the movie again? I mean, can a movie like that be watched twice the same way? Ah, memories flicker.

And now there’s someone with a dog barking in my ear, or maybe it’s a metaphor for something, who knows. Wish I had paid more attention to the soundtrack, but I was too busy thinking how elephants might forget things on purpose, ‘cause it feels like I might be avoiding remembering half the plot.

Ahhhh! My brain's on pause-play-pause... anyway, there was a bluebird cameo that just clicked with me, like when Darwin finagles his worms. At this rate, I’m ready to dive back into research papers tomorrow because I swear there's a parallel somewhere, waiting to be published.

Okay, wrapping up, my movie breakdown might be a movie itself. I’m hungry again, and not for more popcorn. Maybe spaghetti? Ugh, lemme just stop... okay, uh...
